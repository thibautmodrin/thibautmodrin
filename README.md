# 👋 Welcome to my GitHub!

🎯 **Data Engineer | Machine Learning Engineer | ELT Pipelines | MLOps | CI/CD Automation**

I am a Data Engineer in professional transition, specialized in building modern ELT data pipelines using **Airbyte**, **dbt**, **Snowflake**, and **Airflow** to transform raw data into actionable marketing insights and robust, production-ready machine learning models.

💻 **Currently completing the Fullstack & Lead Data Science bootcamp at Jedha**, I focus on:

- Designing and automating ELT data pipelines (Airbyte, dbt, Snowflake, Airflow)
- Data analysis and modeling (Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
- Deploying robust ML APIs (FastAPI) and implementing production monitoring (MLflow, Evidently)
- Automating workflows and deployments with CI/CD best practices for scalability, quality, and maintainability

🔨 **Key Projects:**

- Development and deployment of a Machine Learning prediction model with a Streamlit application to showcase inference results.
- End-to-end data pipeline project: from data ingestion (Airbyte) and transformation (dbt), to cloud data warehousing (Snowflake), ML modeling, API deployment (FastAPI), orchestration (Airflow), MLOps monitoring (MLflow, Evidently), and CI/CD automation for continuous delivery.

🌍 **A bit about me:**  
I've always been drawn to data without realizing it. Passionate about travel, a true connoisseur of Costa Rica 🇨🇷, an epicurean at heart, and a salsa 🎹 enthusiast, I believe curiosity and enjoyment are the best drivers for learning and growth.
